                website from English to Chinese. There are using Weblate, an open-source web-based translation tool with version control

            <h3>Migration to Front-End</h3>
            <p> The migration of back-end development to front-end development focused on 
                addressing challenges related to adjusting tracking zone lines. My primary objective 
                was to successfully retrieve values from JSON data. This involved integrating a 
                canvas element and dynamically drawing multiple lines based on the provided data. 
                Each line was differentiated by color, x, and y coordinates to ensuring clear 
                visualization and functionality. This task allowed me to leverage front-end 
                technologies effectively to enhance the tracking zone line adjustments previously 
                handled by the back-end.

            <h3>Gameplay UI</h3>
            <p> In this Gameplay UI, I involved to design a idle page and choosing character page of a Endless Runner Game.
                I began by creating draft UI designs in Figma, which were reviewed and 
                refined based on feedback from the project leader and team members. After 
                finalizing the designs, I created the necessary UI assets by using the Adobe 
                Illustrator, imported them into Figma, and upon approval, integrated them into 
                Unity. Finally, I exported the project package and delivered it to the team leader 
                for further development.

            <h3>Website Content Optimization</h3>
            <p> The primary objective was to improve website performance and user 
                experience by making several adjustments. Firstly, I resized images to prevent 
                them from overloading the website, ensuring faster loading times and better 
                usability. Secondly, I standardized inconsistent content elements such as color, font 
                size, styling, typography, and background images across the sites. This process 
                aimed to create a cohesive visual identity and improve readability and aesthetics. 
                By addressing these aspects, I aimed to enhance the overall quality and usability 
                of each website, making them more engaging and user-friendly for visitors.

            <h3>'Desk Tag' Product Photo </h3>
            <p> 
                For the 'Desk Tag' product photo task, my responsibilities included capturing and 
                preparing new product photos to replace outdated photo on the official website. 
                In this task I have to photograph the Desk Tag from three different perspectives: front view, 
                back view and use case scanning. Then, I edited them using Photoshop. This process 
                aimed to enhance the product's presentation and maintain a professional 
                appearance on the website, improving overall user experience and product visibility.
